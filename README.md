# Ola's Dotfiles
This repository serves to help me quickly setup my Mac. Basically I don't have to install my core tools and apps manually. Feel free to explore and copy parts to your own dotfiles.

## How to run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/danielolamide/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./setup.sh
```
